# Farmer_Assist
In Sri Lanka, a vast number of families are engaged in farming and farming does a major impact on the Sri Lankan economy. Sri Lanka currently produces a large amount of farm products to attain the demand.  Around 95% of the domestic requirements are satisfied by farming, and as a result, the farmers are pressurized to produce enough goods in a good quality.
<br>As a downside, farmers face many problems in their day-to-day lives. The main issue is the less profit they earn by their production because of intermediaries. Farming requires plenty of conditions and materials which is also a major issue.
<br>The aim of this application is to give farmers a market to sell their vegetation to the buyers without any intermediaries, so that they can get the profit they deserve. With this application, famers can get necessary information about crops and also predictions on weather and vegetation.
